# minr

Minr is a multi-purpose command line tool used for data mining. Minr downloads, indexes and imports source code metadata into the knowledge base.

# Usage (downloading)

Minr takes two arguments: 

* `-d`: Target metadata (CSV) 
* `-u`: Target URL (pointing to a downloadable archive of a given component/version) 

Usage example: 

```
$ minr -d madler,pigz,2.4 -u https://github.com/madler/pigz/archive/v2.4.zip 
```

The target metadata is a comma delimited list of the following fields: 

* Vendor 
* Component 
* Version 

Note: Commas are not admitted in any of these fields.  

## File Discrimination 

The following criteria will be use to discriminate files: 

* File is not a physical file (no symlinks, etc) 
* File extension is blacklisted 
* File size is below a predefined limit
* File header has unwanted contents 

# Creating an Open Source Knowledge Base

The following examples show the entire process for downloading an OSS component, importing it into the Knowledge Base and performing a scan against it using the SCANOSS Open Source Inventory Engine:


## URL mining

URL mining is the process of downloading a component, expanding the files and saving component, metadata and original sources for snippet mining.

```
$ minr -d scanoss,webhook,1.0 -u https://github.com/scanoss/webhook/archive/1.0.tar.gz
Downloading https://github.com/scanoss/webhook/archive/1.0.tar.gz
$
```

A `mined/` directory is created with the downloaded metadata. This includes component and file metadata and source code archives which are kept using the `.mz` archives, specifically designed for this purpose. 

## Snippet mining

Snippet mining is a second step, where snippet information is mined from the `.mz` archives. This is achieved with the `-z` parameter.

```
$ minr -z mined
mined/sources/146a.mz
...
$
```

A `mined/snippets` directory is created with the snippet wfp fingerprints extracted from the `.mz` files located in `mined/sources`

## Data importation into the LDB

```
$ minr -i mined/
$
```

The LDB is now loaded with the component information and a scan can be performed.

## Scanning against the LDB Knowledge Base

The following example shows an entire component match:

```
$ scanoss 1.0.tar.gz 
{
  "1.0.tar.gz": [
    {
      "id": "component",
      "elapsed": "0.001139s",
      "lines": "all",
      "oss_lines": "all",
      "matched": "100%",
      "vendor": "scanoss",
      "component": "webhook",
      "version": "1.0",
      "latest": "1.0",
      "url": "https://github.com/scanoss/webhook/archive/1.0.tar.gz",
      "file": "all",
      "size": "N/A",
      "dependencies": [],
      "licenses": [
        {
          "name": "GPL-2.0-only",
          "source": "declared"
        }
      ]	
    }
  ]
}
$
```

The following example shows an entire file match:

```
$ scanoss webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py 
{
  "webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py": [
    {
      "id": "file",
      "elapsed": "0.000395s",
      "lines": "all",
      "oss_lines": "all",
      "matched": "100%",
      "vendor": "scanoss",
      "component": "webhook",
      "version": "1.0",
      "latest": "1.0",
      "url": "https://github.com/scanoss/webhook/archive/1.0.tar.gz",
      "file": "webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py",
      "size": "6624",
      "dependencies": [],
      "licenses": [
        {
          "name": "GPL-2.0-only",
          "source": "declared"
        }
      ]	
    }
  ]
}
$
```

The following example adds a LF to the end of a file. The modified file does not match entirely anymore, but instead the snippet detection comes into effect: 

```
$ echo -e "\n" >> webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py
$ scanoss webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py 
{
  "webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py": [
    {
      "id": "snippet",
      "elapsed": "0.001812s",
      "lines": "1-192",
      "oss_lines": "3-194",
      "matched": "99%",
      "vendor": "scanoss",
      "component": "webhook",
      "version": "1.0",
      "latest": "1.0",
      "url": "https://github.com/scanoss/webhook/archive/1.0.tar.gz",
      "file": "webhook-1.0/scanoss/github.py",
      "size": "6624",
      "dependencies": [],
      "licenses": [
        {
          "name": "GPL-2.0-only",
          "source": "declared"
        }
      ]	
    }
  ]
}
$
```
 
# Mined/ output structure 

The minr command produces a directory called mined/ containing the mined metadata and original OSS files.  

## Components 

OSS components are saved in a single CSV file called mined/components.csv which contains the original archive md5 hash,  vendor, name, version and url as in the following example: 

```
6c067f97266c817b339f0e989499c8e4,gnu,bison,3.5,https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-3.5.tar.gz
d004ad1ee8d2895994663ab5e05be4d2,gloac,gloac,0.0.2,https://rubygems.org/downloads/gloac-0.0.2.gem 
```

## Files 

OSS files are split in 256 files named `00.csv` to `ff.csv` containing the component archive md5, the file md5, the file length and the file name, as follows: 

```
6c067f97266c817b339f0e989499c8e4,00fc6e8b3ae062fbcfbe8d2e40d36e68,47214,bison-3.5/src/ielr.c
6c067f97266c817b339f0e989499c8e4,00ac96f26eed6fab33d7451e8f697939,17570,bison-3.5/lib/stat-w32.c 
```

## Snippets 

OSS snippets are 32-bit identifiers calculated with the winnowing algorithm. They are saved in binary format split in 256 files called `00.bin` - `ff.bin` containing sequential records composed of:

* 3 bytes for the snippet wfp identifier (the first byte is the file name) 
* 16 bytes for the file md5 where the snippet is found 
* 2 bytes for the line number where the wfp starts 

These `.bin` files can be joined by simple concatenation.

## Sources 

The `sources/` directory is there the original downloaded source files are stored. They are kept in 65536 `.mz` archive files. These files can be listed and extracted using the `unmz` command, which is part of minr. Unlike ZIP files, MZ files can be joined by simple concatenation.

# Minr join 

Minr can also be used to join two `mined/` structures as follows: 

```
$ minr -f dir1/mined -t dir2/mined

```

All files within a `mined/` structure can be joined by simple concatenation. This applies to `.csv`, `.bin` (snippet records) and `.mz` (compressed source code archives). The command above will concatenate all `.csv`, `.bin` and `.mz` files from `dir1/mined` into `dir2/mined`. Files in `dir1/mined` will be erased after concatenation is done.

Minr join also performs a pre-validation on .bin and .mz file integrity (otherwise an error is generated and concatenation is aborted).
